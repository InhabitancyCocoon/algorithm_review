Graph theory and sort algorithm python code playground.

Graph theory includes:
single shortest path (dijkstra, bellman_ford), minimum spanning tree (kruskal, prim). 
I provide alternative version with different time complexity.

Sort algorithm includes:
merge_sort, insert_sort, heap_sort, count_sort, radix_sort, quick_sort, chosen_sort, bubble_sort.
Notice that I do not test the stability.

Use pytest -k prefix to test your implementation.

e.g., if your want to test the insert sort function, just type pytest -k insert in your cmd, e.g. pytest -k bellman_ford.


My solution has passed the test on https://workat.tech/, I'll be grateful if you report any mistake.
